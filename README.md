</div>

Xenon Repository is a **collection of optimizations** for the operating system, Windows (Microsoft Windows). From specfic command lines and registry, to PowerShell. This repository is mainly **a lot of scripts and optimizations found in the inernet, bundled into one massive list**.

## üìö Purpose?
Mainly to give everyone **a way to easily get Windows optimizations** without looking over 19 pages of Google. It's free, as it should be and for the **content creators out there who make FPS Boosting Guides, USE THIS REPO!**

## ‚ú® What's so special?
Aside from being a great area to get scripts and commands, it also includes **an AIO Injecter**, which at 1 command, can** automatically apply all the commands at once**, **saving time** and being _'plug-&-play'_ styled. The AIO is the **main foucus in terms of updating this repo**, but **new scripts, if possible, will be added into the repository as well**.

You can go to the 'scripts' folder on 'main/scripts' to see all the files and its code.

## üìù Licensing
Although XeRepo is licened under MIT, I say, **it does not count with the raw code**, meaning the registry key or that one 'bcdedit' command, etc. **will not be licensed**.

It is only :
- **Assets** (Images, and this Repo)
- **Direct Copy/Paste** of Files
- **AIO Injecto**r

The raw code can be **extracted and be used without giving credits** to this repository like the MIT license asks you so. But, it is **appriciated for you to star this repo** to show it to a larger and boader audience. Thank you.

And if you are **using AIO Injector** in your matter, even if with remix or adaptation, the MIT license **must be included** too.
