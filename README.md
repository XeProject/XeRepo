Xenon Repository is a **collection of optimizations** for the operating system, Windows (Microsoft Windows). From specfic command lines and registry, to PowerShell. This repository is mainly **a lot of scripts and optimizations found in the inernet, bundled into one massive list**.

## 📚 Purpose?
Mainly to give everyone **a way to easily get Windows optimizations** without looking over 19 pages of Google. It's free, as it should be and for the **content creators out there who make FPS Boosting Guides, USE THIS REPO!**

## ⭐ What type of optimizations?
This repository consists of scripts that **range from surface-level tweaks to debloating your PC**. **All aiming to sync with each other to get the most smooth experience on low end systems and Avg/1% FPS in games.**

> [!NOTE]
> **This includes** :
> - Batch Commands (.bat)
> - PowerShell Scripts (.ps1)
> - Regisrty Tweaks (regedit)
> - Power Plan Optimizations (powercfg)
> - Debloater (dism - appx)
> - Services (sc)
> - Boot Configuration Edits (bcdedit)
> - Task Scheduler Changes (schtask)
> - Disable Telemetry
> - Core Parking
> - Xbox-Related
> - Fullscreen Optimizations,
> etc.

## ✨ What's so special?
Aside from being a great area to get scripts and commands, it also includes **an AIO Injecter**, which we call it "Xenon Injector" / XeInject, or XI for short, which at 1 command, can **automatically apply all the commands at once**, **saving time** and being _'plug-&-play'_ styled. XI is the **main foucus in terms of updating this repo**, but **new scripts, if possible, will be added into the repository as well**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can go to the 'scripts' folder on 'main/scripts' to see all the files and its code.

## 💻 Windows Version
Most of the scripts in this repoistory **can be used from Windows 7 to 11**, but XI may **not fully be comaptibile with any verion under Windows 10 1904**.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't take my word, this is **not proven statements and no tesing on version below Windows 10 has been taken**.

## 📝 Licensing
Although XeRepo is licened under MIT, I say, **it does not count with the raw code**, meaning the registry key or that one 'bcdedit' command, etc. **will not be licensed**.

It is only :
- **Assets** (Images, and this Repo)
- **Direct Copy/Paste** of Files
- **XeInject "XI"**

The raw code can be **extracted and be used without giving credits** to this repository like the MIT license asks you so. But, it is **appriciated for you to star this repo** to show it to a larger and boader audience. Thank you.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you are **using XI** in your matter, even if with remix or adaptation, the MIT license **must be included** too.

## Credits

> [!NOTE]
